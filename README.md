# Summary of Sorting Algorithms
After using the sorting algorithms provided in summary, each algorithm is case dependent. However some algorithms can be interchanged in similar situations.
The main factors that determine which algorithm is best in a situaion are as follows:
- The size of data being sorted
- Ease of Implementation

1. Size of Data
Algorithms for Large Sets of Data
   - Heap Sort
   - Merge Sort
     
Why: The reasons these algorithms are best used for large data sets are due to how they deal with their data. A heap sort's effciency does not depend on its intial data size, therefor allowing it to complete its task no matter how large the data set is. The disadvantage
of this is that the heap sort is unstable. A merge sort's effciency is also fast when dealing with a large set of data due to its functionality breaking up data into small chunks.

2. Ease of Implementation
   Easily Implemented Algorithms
    - Bubble Sort
    - Insertion Sort
    - Selection Sort
      
Why: The reason these algorithms are implented easily is becasue of their structure's. These algorithms are implmented most of the time within one method. This allows for them to be easily typed, however does not make them suitable for all situations. A bubble sort is stable, yet not adaptive. An insertion sort and selection sort is not stable nor adaptive.
